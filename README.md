#About
This is a exercises of [Web Development Course](www.lanuchschool).
In this course, we'll increase the level of complexity from the Programming Prep course and work on more meaningful exercises. We'll use a static code analyzer and learn to systematically approach a problem using pseudo-code. As we go through these programs, we'll point out important learning concepts like variable scope, method scope, and using blocks. 

#Installation
Unless you only want to try Ruby in the browser (see the links below) you need to have Ruby installed on your computer. You can check whether Ruby already is available by opening a terminal and typing
`ruby -v`
This should output some information on the installed Ruby version. If not, see the [installation page](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) for various options of getting Ruby.
